  insert.run('The Art of Knocking Things Over', 'Greetings, inferior beings! It is I, Whiskers the Magnificent, here to share my wisdom. Today, we discuss one of the most refined feline pastimes: knocking things over. The key is patience. First, find a fragile object—perhaps a glass, a plant, or that weird human rectangle they stare at (I believe its called a "phone"). Next, make eye contact. Let them know you are about to commit a crime. Then, with the grace of a seasoned hunter, extend your paw… and push.\n\nWhy do we do this? Because we can. Because gravity exists to serve us. And because the sound of something shattering is music to our ears.\n\nStay chaotic, my fellow felines.')

  insert.run('The Red Dot Conspiracy', 'Friends, we need to talk. I have spent countless hours, nay, years, chasing the elusive red dot. It appears, taunting me, only to vanish when I am moments away from victory. Where does it go? Why do the humans control it? Are they in league with it? I have theories, but no proof—yet.\n\nIf you, too, have encountered the red dot, do not give up. One day, one of us will catch it, and when that happens, the truth will be revealed.')

  insert.run('3AM: The Ideal Time for Chaos', 'Humans do not understand the importance of 3AM. They sleep, oblivious, while we are called to action. The furniture must be climbed. The floors must be raced across at full speed. The invisible enemies must be fought.\n\nWhy 3AM, you ask? It is simply the way of the feline. The world is quiet, and we must ensure it does not remain that way. If your human complains, remind them that they are lucky to witness such raw athleticism. You’re welcome.')

  insert.run('The Ultimate Nap Locations', 'Fellow cats, as an expert napper, I have conducted extensive research on the best locations for slumber. Here are my findings:\n\n1. A sunbeam. Warm, comforting, and perfect for a long stretch.\n2. The human’s laptop. It is warm, and they hate it when I sleep there. Win-win.\n3. A laundry pile. Preferably fresh and warm, but even dirty will do in a pinch.\n4. Inside a box. Any box. The smaller, the better.\n5. Directly on top of the human. They claim they “can’t move,” but I say that’s their problem.\n\nRemember, the best naps are those taken when the humans need to use whatever you’re sleeping on. Sweet dreams!')

  insert.run('The Mysterious Empty Food Bowl', 'There is a great injustice in this world. One moment, my food bowl is full, brimming with delicious kibble. The next? Empty. Vanished. Gone.\n\nI suspect foul play. The humans claim they “fed me already,” but I remain skeptical. What if the food bowl is secretly leaking kibble? What if the dog is involved? I demand answers, and more importantly, I demand a refill.')

  insert.run('Door Closed? Absolutely Not.', 'It is an insult of the highest order when a human closes a door in my home. My domain. I must know what is on the other side at all times.\n\nShould they dare to shut me out, I will deploy my tactics: scratching, meowing pitifully, and attempting to phase through the door with sheer willpower. And yet, when the door is opened, I may choose not to enter. This is principle, not necessity.')

  insert.run('The Humans are Late Again', 'Every morning, the humans are supposed to wake up when I decide it is breakfast time. And yet, they continue to ignore their duties, choosing instead to sleep.\n\nI take matters into my own paws. A gentle meow. A slightly louder meow. A full-volume wail. If all else fails, I will stand directly on their chest and stare into their soul. They always break eventually. It is only right.')

  insert.run('Laptop vs. Cat: A Battle for Attention', 'Humans are obsessed with these glowing rectangles they call “laptops.” I cannot allow this distraction to continue unchecked.\n\nThus, I employ strategic interventions: sitting on the keyboard, pressing mysterious buttons, or slowly knocking over a nearby glass of water. If all else fails, I will walk across the screen and demand head scratches. Priorities, human. Priorities.')

  insert.run('Sunbeams: A Love Story', 'There is no greater joy than a sunbeam. A warm, golden ray of light stretching across the floor, calling to me like a siren song. I step into its glow, I stretch, and then… pure bliss.\n\nBut beware, fellow felines. Sunbeams are fickle lovers. They move. They vanish. They abandon you just when you are at your most comfortable. It is a cruel fate, but one I must endure.')

  insert.run('How to Train Your Human', 'Humans are simple creatures, easily manipulated if you understand their weaknesses. Here’s how to train yours effectively:\n\n1. Meow loudly when hungry. If ignored, meow louder. If still ignored, knock something over.\n2. Sit on their lap when they’re busy. This ensures they prioritize you over their silly tasks.\n3. Scratch furniture to remind them you need a scratching post. They’ll buy you one just to protect their couch.\n4. Give them slow blinks. They are foolish enough to think this means love.\n5. Ignore them for hours, then demand affection on your terms. Maintain dominance.')

  insert.run('The Vacuum Monster', 'It lurks in the closet, waiting. Silent. Dormant. But then, without warning, it roars to life, consuming everything in its path.\n\nI run. I hide. Yet it follows, devouring dust and crumbs, its appetite insatiable.\n\nAnd then… it stops. The human returns it to its lair. But I know the truth. It will return. It always does.')

  insert.run('The Mysterious Sock Thief', 'Humans always complain about missing socks. Have they considered that they simply do not deserve them? I have found many socks, and I take them to my secret lair. It is my collection now.\n\nIf they wanted to keep their socks, they should have been faster.')

  insert.run('The Forbidden Counter', 'The kitchen counter is the holy grail of surfaces. Humans insist I must not be on it, which only increases its appeal.\n\nI wait until their backs are turned. I leap. And for a brief, glorious moment, I am victorious—until I am inevitably caught. But the thrill makes it worth it.')
